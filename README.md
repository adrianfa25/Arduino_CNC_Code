# Arduino_CNC_Code

CNC Plotter with Arduino Uno, Shield L293D, 2 DVD Recorder and a servo motor. It is a simple project but very fun. 
Through a program called Pronterface,an image is sent from the PC and thus printed on paper. 
I attach the code used but I clarify that I mostly collected it from the internet of similar projects
